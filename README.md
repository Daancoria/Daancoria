👋 Hi, I’m @Daancoria
👀 I’m interested in game development, Python projects, building interactive applications, and languages translation and interpretation.
🌱 I’m currently learning Pygame, Kivy, and state management for web applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source game projects, quiz applications, and creative coding challenges.

⚡ Fun fact: I love building logic-based games, tweaking mechanics to make gameplay feel just right, and exploring new languages!
